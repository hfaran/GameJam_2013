If you've successfully installed all the requirements,
   now you can launch the tutorials by double clicking on Tutorials.sln


The solution has a project with default, most basic tutorial set.


You can build and run it with F5 key.


After you've finished it, you can run another tutorial,
   by replacing the *.cpp file with another located in the "Source" folder, to do so :

- go to Visual Studio Solution Explorer window
- select the *.cpp file in "Source" folder (in Tutorials project)
- push 'delete' key or right click on the *.cpp file and select "remove"
- then right click on "Source" folder and select "Add existing item"
- pick another *.cpp file in the "Source" folder
- run the new tutorial with F5 key



It is suggested to finish all the basic tutorials before launching those in "Advanced" folder.



Try experimenting in the tutorials by changing different values.
